#LocalRSSReader

A small project I am working on to make an rss reader which works "locally"

What I want is basically have a file with a kind of structure like:
"FeedName:FeedURL"

It will read through it one by one and in short make an rss reader with the
items ordered by date posted.

Ideally I kind of want this to replace youtube subscriptions, thumbnails are
desired and whatnot if possible, maybe look at the youtube api or something?

This project is more or less never going to be complete
